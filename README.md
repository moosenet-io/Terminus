# Terminus

**The Rust MCP tool hub and federated gateway for the Lumina constellation — one
authenticated front door for agent tool egress, with ~53 tools, one per
integrated service.**

## What Terminus is

Terminus is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) tool hub written in Rust: a single
governed registry through which agents reach every external system a fleet
needs — git forges, project trackers, infrastructure, finance, calendars,
secrets, model-profiling primitives, and dozens of personal/life-admin
integrations. Rather than each agent embedding its own HTTP clients and
credentials, agents speak MCP to one surface, and Terminus dispatches each
call to a typed, sandboxed tool implementation (`RustTool`: a stable name, a
JSON Schema, a description, and an async `execute`).

Terminus is also the constellation's **gateway** — its `terminus-primary`
binary is the mTLS front door agents actually connect to. A client that
authenticates to `terminus-primary` sees an *aggregated* surface: the core
tool registry served locally, plus the personal-registry tools federated in
from a `terminus_personal` deployment, so one connection reaches both without
the caller needing to know which process owns which tool. **Terminus is the
primary entry point for the fleet; [Chord](https://github.com/moosenet-io/Chord)
is a separate process that bolts on for inference** — `terminus-primary`
forwards chat-completion/inference routes straight through to Chord over the
same federated transport, streamed chunk by chunk, so a single front door
covers both tool calls and model inference without the caller juggling two
endpoints. See [`docs/architecture/chord-integration.md`](docs/architecture/chord-integration.md)
for the full boundary and wire contract.

Every tool implements the same small trait, uses typed HTTP clients
(`reqwest`) and parameterized SQL (`sqlx`) for all external I/O — never
shell-outs — and registers into a central `ToolRegistry` that handles
dispatch, duplicate detection, and catalog listing.

## Architecture

<img src="assets/architecture.svg" alt="Terminus architecture" width="100%">

MCP clients connect over stdio or HTTP/mTLS transports to the Terminus core
MCP server, which owns dispatch, JSON-Schema validation, and governance.
Governance is mandatory and layered: a path-jailed filesystem, vault-only
secret access (no raw environment reads for secrets), a PII gate, and a
sanitized audit log — tools are read-only by default, write scopes are
explicit. Behind the registry sit the 52 domain tool modules, each owning its
own typed client and credentials. See
[`docs/architecture/`](docs/architecture/) for the federation, auth, and
Chord-integration deep-dives.

## At a glance

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Tools** | ~53, one per integrated service (GitHub, Plane, Prometheus, …). Each tool exposes a set of **actions** that vary with the backing service and change over time — ~300 individual MCP callables in total across all tools. |
| **Transport** | stdio (local/SSH) and HTTP, with an mTLS listener for federated/remote clients |
| **Auth** | per-identity mTLS client certificates (`crate::pki`); named-identity tokens (`GITEA_PAT_<NAME>`, `PLANE_PAT_<NAME>`) for outbound git-forge/tracker calls |
| **Governance** | path-jailed filesystem access, vault-only secrets (never a raw `env::var` for a credential), a mandatory Rust PII gate on every public-forge write, sanitized audit logging |
| **Flagship harness** | **MINT** — the model-intake/serving-profile CLI and tool suite. One `MintHarness` orchestrator drives both sweep families (`RunKind::Coder` for the code sweep, `RunKind::Assistant` for the Lumina seven-dimension sweep) through one lifecycle over the shared `lumina_intake` DB; the two standalone sweep binaries are thin `MintHarness::run(RunKind::…)` entrypoints. See [`docs/tools/README.md`](docs/tools/README.md#mint-flagship) |
| **Inference** | proxied to the separate [Chord](https://github.com/moosenet-io/Chord) process — Terminus does tool egress, Chord does inference egress |

## Quickstart

```sh
git clone <your-terminus-repo-url>
cd terminus-rs
cargo build --release
```

Terminus ships three binaries:

- **`terminus_personal`** — the personal/admin registry (ledger, vitals,
  crucible, relay, meridian, odyssey, and other life-admin + git/tracker
  tools), served over a plain listener plus an optional mTLS listener.
- **`terminus_primary`** — the gateway binary: serves the **core** registry
  locally and federates in the personal registry's tools from a
  `terminus_personal` deployment, over the same mTLS/`enroll` front door, plus
  forwards inference routes to Chord.
- **`pii_gate`** — the standalone PII/secret-scanning binary used as a git
  pre-push/pre-commit hook and by the public-mirror engine.

Configuration is entirely environment-driven — every credential is expected
to already be materialized into the process environment by your own secret
manager at startup (Terminus never reads a raw literal token from config).
For a full walkthrough of standing up a client against a running Terminus —
enrollment, mTLS certs, and the personal-services deployment shape — see the
deployment guides:

- [`docs/deploy/client.md`](docs/deploy/client.md) — connecting a new MCP
  client (enrollment, certs, transport selection).
- [`docs/deploy/personal-services.md`](docs/deploy/personal-services.md) —
  standing up `terminus_personal` / `terminus_primary`.
