# Tool index

[← docs index](../README.md)

Terminus registers ~300 tools across 51 domain modules (`src/registry.rs`'s
`register_all` and `register_personal` — see
[`architecture/federation.md`](../architecture/federation.md) for which
registry serves which module). This page groups every module into one of five
domains plus the **MINT** flagship harness, with an approximate tool count and
a one-line description sourced from that module's own top-of-file doc comment
or registration site — never guessed. Each module links to its planned
per-tool reference page(s) under `docs/tools/<domain>/`; those pages are
filled in by sibling doc pages, one per tool, covering the exact input
schema, output shape, error paths, and a worked example.

Tool counts below are read directly off each module's `register()` /
`register_all()` call site (`Box::new(...)` entries registered into the
`ToolRegistry`) as of this doc pass — they will drift as modules gain or lose
tools; treat them as approximate, not a frozen contract.

## MINT flagship

MINT is Terminus's flagship harness: the model-intake / serving-profile
system that loads a fleet model, runs graduated context/code/agent suites
against it, and stores a derived operational profile (safe/absolute context
ceilings, throughput curve, recommended timeouts, degradation point, and — as
of the serving-profile extension — per-(model × backend) launch runtime,
measured VRAM/RAM peak, cold-load time, and `keep_warm`/`exclusion_reason`
metadata) in Postgres. It ships two front doors over the same library entry
points ([`src/intake/`](../../src/intake/)):

- The **`intake`** tool module (4 MCP tools: `model_intake`,
  `model_intake_status`, `model_intake_compare`, `model_intake_fleet`) —
  callable from any MCP client.
- The **`mint`** CLI binary ([`src/bin/mint.rs`](../../src/bin/mint.rs)) — a
  clap-derived subcommand tree (`mint sweep coder`, `mint sweep assistant`,
  `mint case`, `mint gaps`, `mint gpu status/acquire/release`, `mint
  supervisor run/install/uninstall`, `mint fetch-model`) that is a more
  discoverable operator front door over the *same* run functions the legacy
  standalone binaries (`intake_coder_sweep`, `intake_coder_case`,
  `intake_coder_gaps`, `intake_assistant_sweep`) call — nothing is
  duplicated, and the legacy binaries remain first-class.

See [`mint/`](mint/) for the full flagship manual: the sweep/case/gaps
lifecycle, the GPU-authority lock (`gpu_authority`), the permanent
jam-detect supervisor daemon, and the Chord `PullCoordinator` re-pull
delegation.

## Domains

---

Every module above registers through either `register_all` (the CORE
registry, served by `terminus-primary`/Chord) or `register_personal` (the
PERSONAL registry, served by `terminus_personal`) — some register into both.
See [`../architecture/federation.md`](../architecture/federation.md) for
exactly which registry serves which module and how `terminus-primary`
aggregates them into one client-visible catalog.
